# Optimal-design-of-solid-state-thermal-diode

In this project, a python code is provided to check the relation between T_f and T_r at optimal rectification of solid-state thermal diode. Several iterations are perfomed with different material functions (i.e.,K1(T) and K2(T)). And it is found that in all cases maximum rectification occurs when T_f=T_r.
